//! A realtime-safe single-producer single-consumer (SPSC) ring buffer.
//!
//! A [`RingBuffer`] consists of two parts:
//! a [`Producer`] for writing into the ring buffer and
//! a [`Consumer`] for reading from the ring buffer.
//!
//! A fixed-capacity buffer is allocated on construction.
//! After that, no more memory is allocated (unless the type `T` does that internally).
//! Reading from and writing into the ring buffer is *lock-free* and *wait-free*.
//! All reading and writing functions return immediately.
//! Attempts to write to a full buffer return an error;
//! values inside the buffer are *not* overwritten.
//! Attempts to read from an empty buffer return an error as well.
//! Only a single thread can write into the ring buffer and a single thread
//! (typically a different one) can read from the ring buffer.
//! If the queue is empty, there is no way for the reading thread to wait
//! for new data, other than trying repeatedly until reading succeeds.
//! Similarly, if the queue is full, there is no way for the writing thread
//! to wait for newly available space to write to, other than trying repeatedly.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Moving single elements into and out of a queue with
//! [`Producer::push()`] and [`Consumer::pop()`], respectively:
//!
//! ```
//! use rtrb::{RingBuffer, PushError, PopError};
//!
//! let (mut producer, mut consumer) = RingBuffer::new(2);
//!
//! assert_eq!(producer.push(10), Ok(()));
//! assert_eq!(producer.push(20), Ok(()));
//! assert_eq!(producer.push(30), Err(PushError::Full(30)));
//!
//! std::thread::spawn(move || {
//!     assert_eq!(consumer.pop(), Ok(10));
//!     assert_eq!(consumer.pop(), Ok(20));
//!     assert_eq!(consumer.pop(), Err(PopError::Empty));
//! }).join().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! See the documentation of the [`chunks#examples`] module
//! for examples that write multiple items at once with
//! [`Producer::write_chunk_uninit()`] and [`Producer::write_chunk()`]
//! and read multiple items with [`Consumer::read_chunk()`].
