Real-Time Ring Buffer
=====================

A wait-free single-producer single-consumer ring buffer for Rust.

* Crate: https://crates.io/crates/rtrb
* Documentation: https://docs.rs/rtrb

This crate can be used without the standard library (`#![no_std]`)
by disabling the `std` feature (which is enabled by default),
but the [alloc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/) crate is needed nevertheless.


Usage
-----

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rtrb = "0.1"
```


Development
-----------

Running the tests:

    cargo test

Testing the benchmarks (without actually benchmarking):

    cargo test --benches

Running the benchmarks (using the [criterion](https://docs.rs/criterion/) crate;
results will be available in `target/criterion/report/index.html`):

    cargo bench

Creating the HTML docs (which will be available in `target/doc/rtrb/index.html`):

    cargo doc


Minimum Supported `rustc` Version
---------------------------------

This crate's minimum supported `rustc` version (MSRV) is `1.36.0`.
The MSRV is not expected to be updated frequently, but if it is,
there will be (at least) a *minor* version bump.


Origin Story
------------

The initial code has been ripped off of https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/338,
with permission of the PR author.

It has been isolated from the rest of `crossbeam` with [git-filter-repo]:

    git-filter-repo --subdirectory-filter crossbeam-queue --path src/spsc.rs --path tests/spsc.rs --refs refs/heads/spsc

Alternatives
------------

If you don't like this crate, no problem, there are several alternatives for you to choose from.
There are many varieties of ring buffers available, here we limit the selection
to wait-free SPSC implementations:

* [heapless](https://crates.io/crates/heapless) (for embedded systems, see `heapless::spsc`)
* [jack](https://crates.io/crates/jack) (FFI bindings for JACK, see `jack::Ringbuffer`)
* [npnc](https://crates.io/crates/npnc) (see `npnc::bounded::spsc` module)
* [ringbuf](https://crates.io/crates/ringbuf)
* [shmem-ipc](https://crates.io/crates/shmem-ipc) (see `shmem_ipc::sharedring` and `shmem_ipc::ringbuf` modules)
* [spsc-bounded-queue](https://crates.io/crates/spsc-bounded-queue)

There are also implementations in other languages:

* [boost::lockfree::spsc_queue](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/master/doc/html/boost/lockfree/spsc_queue.html) (C++)
* [JACK ring buffer](https://jackaudio.org/api/ringbuffer_8h.html)  (C)
* [PortAudio ring buffer](http://portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs-dev/pa__ringbuffer_8h.html) (C)
